This Project fetches data from an API and shows the data in a list. 

This little project is part of my learning journey. I have recently started learning React JS as the first step of becoming a MERN stack developer. Made this project to practice what I had learned so far.
this project includes the following concepts.
-useState
-useEffect
-async
-fetching data from an API.

All of this is done in react for now. I will be publishing my progress from now on
